<h2 id="purpose_and_rationale">Purpose and Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    The PanOps Platform is designed to be a <em>reliable</em>, <em>operable</em>, <em>distributed</em>, <em>self-organizing</em>,
    <em>resource management</em> <em>platform</em> for <em>distributed applications</em>.
  </p>
  <h3 id="purpose_and_rationale_reliable">Reliable</h3>
    <p>
      Reliability is the prime aspiration and guarantee of PanOps. Reliability, for PanOps, is best described as determinism. Given a known state of those resources, and a transformation from
      that state to another given state PanOps components should always converge to the same result.
    </p>
  <h3 id="purpose_and_rationale_operable">Operable</h3>
    <p>
      Operability refers to the ability of a system to keep its operators informed of its state in the past, present, and when known, future and to hold that state given changes in the
      surrounding resources. PanOps components chronicle all actions, decisions, and considerations and their reasons in a standard format using a standard interface for retrieval so
      that if human intervention into system operation is required to debug a problem or correct an issue context may be quickly gathered and corrective action may be taken.
