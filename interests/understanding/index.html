PanOps is currently undergoing heavy development and the claims represented below represent a manifesto for the direction of the PanOps platform. 
PanOps's current capabilities are located in the <em>CAPABILITIES</em> file at the root of each PanOps platform release. 
If you just want to know the recommended ways to interact with PanOps, go ahead and skip down to the summary.

<div class="top_level section" id="purpose_and_rationale">
<h2>Purpose and Rationale</h2>
  <p>
  The PanOps Platform is envisioned to standardize distributed systems resource management in order to implement instances of distributed applications.
  </p>
  <p>
  Prior to the creation of PanOps individuals or groups that wished to manage diverse sets of resources, both local or utility based, either had to invent ad-hoc systems
  built in house, or couple themselves to proprietary utility computing management platforms like Heroku, or Amazon's CloudFormation system. PanOps provides a 
  freely available, consistently interfaced, and well integrated alternative to either massive in-house development or proprietary lock-in, as well as access to a rich 
  toolset and a well-tested, ready-built customizable systems management solution.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="top_level section" id="what_is_panops">
<h2>What is PanOps?</h2>

  <p>
    The PanOps Platform is a <em>reliable</em>, <em>operable</em>, <em>distributed</em>, <em>secure</em>, <em>self-organizing</em>,
    <em>resource management</em> <em>platform</em> for <em>distributed applications</em>.
  </p>
  
  <div class="section" id="reliable">
  <h3>Reliable</h3>
    <p>
      Reliability is the first guarantee of the PanOps platform. In relationship to the PanOps platform, reliability is best described as determinism. That is, when given a 
      known state of managed resources and information about that knowledge, and a transformation from that state to another given state PanOps components should always 
      converge on an identical resultant state. This component behavior provides predictability in operations, eases testing, and codifies expectations for developer operators.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="operable">
  <h3>Operable</h3>
    <p>
      Operability refers to the ability of a system to keep its operators informed of its state and the information about that state in the past, present, and when known, future 
      and to hold that state constant given changes in the state or availability of surrounding resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps handles failure as a first class citizen. In any distributed system, failure is inevitable. PanOps handles failures in underlying resources by continuously monitoring
      and reacting to resource state changes, automatically reconverging the system to its goal state without human interaction. Only if PanOps is or may be unable to successfully 
      automatically reconverge the system to the specified goal state is corrective action required.
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of operability is understanding that complete system failure in the face of calamity is always a possibility. PanOps platform services will make every effort to ensure
      a clean shutdown or degradation of affected services and a quick return to fully functional operation when a large enough number of resources have been restored to support the
      applications workload.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps components chronicle all actions, decisions, and considerations and their reasons in a standard format using a standard interface for retrieval so
      that if human intervention into system operation is required to debug a problem or correct an issue context may be quickly gathered and effective corrective action may be taken.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="distributed">
  <h3>Distributed</h3>
    <p>
      The distributed nature of arbitrary sets of resources on which the management system resides, most of which can fail at any time, require that a system designed for managing those 
      resources itself also be distributed. As such, no node participating in a PanOps resource management system is special, and any node may take over the functions of any other node 
      at any time, should that take over be determined to be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps services take great care to ensure that durable state is maintained consistently in multiple locations, the placement of which is designed to survive multiple resource failure or
      destruction. This process requires PanOps to be resource placement aware, and so, resource placement and dependencies are central to resource metadata management and greatly effect how
      PanOps places its own service on available resources.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="secure">
  <h3>Secure</h3>
    <p>
      PanOps services understand that the world in which components exist may be byzantine. Therefore, messages sent between components are signed, and if applicable, encrypted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To implement this requirement, all services verify the signature and identity of the sender of incoming messages and verify the authorization of the sender to perform the requested 
      operation or communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Resources are segmented into trusted and untrusted spheres. This feature enables automatic unencrypted low-overhead communication between distributed components/resources where the 
      communications medium over which the communication shall pass is under the complete control of a <a href="/lexicon#Developer_Operator">Developer Operator</a> trusted entity while still allowing the PanOps system to maintain security 
      guarantees when additional untrusted resources (for example, a utility computing account) are added to the PanOps operating theater. Another example of an application this feature enables would be
      the secure storage of PanOps system private keys and certificates, such that PanOps is free to move this private information within the trusted sphere to ensure reliability while not exposing it 
      to untrusted networks or storage media.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="self-organizing">
  <h3>Self-Organizing</h3>
    <p>
      As available computing resources may change at any moment, PanOps must be responsible for determining which compute resources are responsible for the task of managing resources, storing persistent data, as well as other
      tasks required for administering and ensuring the continuity and managability of the PanOps platform instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of these requirements, PanOps assimilates available computing resources and makes them available for servicing both application load as well as managing the platform, depending on need and security
      restrictions.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="resource_management">
  <h3>Resource Management</h3>
    <p>
      Resources are the central abstraction in PanOps. Just as in Unix, where everything is a file, in PanOps everything is a resource. Everything is a resource -- data centers are a resource, physical components like hard drives, processors, 
      motherboards, system units are all resources, up to an including without limitation applications and their files and interdependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps provides APIs to manipulate and manage the lifecycle of all of these resources. Intelligent agents included with PanOps perform common functions to remove the burden of regular tasks such as, but not limited to,
      adding new resources into the system, recovering from resource failure, or dealing with new application deployments, dependencies, and requirements. PanOps also supports and recommends the creation and sharing of new intelligent
      agents to remove the burden of regular but potentially specialized or application specific tasks such as performing automatic regular maintenance on site hardware, or adjusting the cooling requirements for a group of servers depending
      on application load.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="platform">
  <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p>
      PanOps, in providing resource management and intelligent agent functionality, is attempting to create a stable, operable, responsive environment for itself, your applications, and their dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a PanOps system developer, PanOps is developed within itself, meaning that it is self-hosting. PanOps system developers must use the same toolchain and APIs as client application developers for developing system
      services. This ensures that client application developers receive a highly polished, well maintained and well used client application sdk as it must exist for PanOps to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a client application developer, PanOps provides a stable, consistent, well-documented services APIs and enables rapid application prototyping and roll-out with built in continuous
      integration resource management support.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a user of client applications hosted on a PanOps platform, no aspect of application access or usage need be modified unless the client application developer wishes it so.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="distributed_applications">
  <h3>Distributed Applications</h3>
    <p>
      PanOps provides support for distributed client applications, that is, applications with multiple components, requiring dependency and connection management. Note that this is not distributed in the typical sense, but 
      distributed in the sense that the application can have many components running on separate compute resources in order to provide a single service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some examples of distributed applications, in the PanOps sense, are: web applications (with components such as front-ends, load balancers, and database dependencies), distributed database services such as HBase (which depends
      on the Hadoop system to provide data storage) or CouchDB (which uses management layers like BigCouch to provide a single query endpoint), and content streaming and distribution systems (transcoders, storage, and large bandwidth management).
