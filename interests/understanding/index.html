<p id="intro">
PanOps is currently undergoing heavy development and the claims represented below represent a manifesto for the direction of the PanOps platform. 
PanOps's current capabilities are located in the <em>CAPABILITIES</em> file at the root of each PanOps platform release. 
If you just want to know the recommended ways to interact with PanOps, go ahead and skip down to the summary.

<h2 id="purpose_and_rationale">Purpose and Rationale</h2>

  <p>
  The PanOps Platform was created to standardize distrubted systems resource management in order to implement instances of distributed applications. Prior to
  the creation of PanOps individuals or groups that wished to manage diverse sets of resources, both local or utility based, either had to invent ad-hoc systems
  built in house, or couple themselves to proprietary utility computing management platforms like Heroku, or Amazon's CloudFormation system. PanOps provides a 
  freely available, consistently interfaced, and well integrated alternative to either in-house development or proprietary lock-in, as well as access to a rich 
  toolset and a well tested, ready-built system.
  </p>

<h2 id="what_is_panops">What is PanOps?</h2>

  <p>
    The PanOps Platform is a <em>reliable</em>, <em>operable</em>, <em>distributed</em>, <em>self-organizing</em>,
    <em>resource management</em> <em>platform</em> for <em>distributed applications</em>.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="purpose_and_rationale_reliable">Reliable</h3>
    <p>
      Reliability is the first guarantee of the PanOps platform. In relationship to the PanOps platform, reliability is best described as determinism. That is, when given a 
      known state of managed resources and information about that knowledge, and a transformation from that state to another given state PanOps components should always 
      converge on an identical resultant state. This component behavior provides predictability in operations, eases testing, and codifies expections for developer operators.
    </p>
  <h3 id="purpose_and_rationale_operable">Operable</h3>
    <p>
      Operability refers to the ability of a system to keep its operators informed of its state and the information about that state in the past, present, and when known, future 
      and to hold that state constant given changes in the state or availability of surrounding resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps handles failure as a first class citizen. In any distributed system, failure is inevitable. PanOps handles failures in underlying resources by continuously monitoring
      and reacting to resource state changes, automatically reconverging the system to its goal state without human interaction. Only if PanOps is or may be unable to successfully 
      automatically reconverge the system to the specified goal state is corrective action required.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps components chronicle all actions, decisions, and considerations and their reasons in a standard format using a standard interface for retrieval so
      that if human intervention into system operation is required to debug a problem or correct an issue context may be quickly gathered and effective corrective action may be taken.
