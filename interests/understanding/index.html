PanOps is currently undergoing heavy development and the claims represented below represent a manifesto for the direction of the PanOps platform. 
PanOps's current capabilities are located in the <em>CAPABILITIES</em> file at the root of each PanOps platform release. 
If you just want to know the recommended ways to interact with PanOps, go ahead and skip down to the summary.

<h2>Purpose and Rationale</h2>
  <p>
  The PanOps Platform was created to standardize distrubted systems resource management in order to implement instances of distributed applications. Prior to
  the creation of PanOps individuals or groups that wished to manage diverse sets of resources, both local or utility based, either had to invent ad-hoc systems
  built in house, or couple themselves to proprietary utility computing management platforms like Heroku, or Amazon's CloudFormation system. PanOps provides a 
  freely available, consistently interfaced, and well integrated alternative to either massive in-house development or proprietary lock-in, as well as access to a rich 
  toolset and a well tested, ready-built system.

<h2>What is PanOps?</h2>

  <p>
    The PanOps Platform is a <em>reliable</em>, <em>operable</em>, <em>distributed</em>, <em>secure</em>, <em>self-organizing</em>,
    <em>resource management</em> <em>platform</em> for <em>distributed applications</em>.
  </p>
  
  <div class="section" id="reliable">
  <h3>Reliable</h3>
    <p>
      Reliability is the first guarantee of the PanOps platform. In relationship to the PanOps platform, reliability is best described as determinism. That is, when given a 
      known state of managed resources and information about that knowledge, and a transformation from that state to another given state PanOps components should always 
      converge on an identical resultant state. This component behavior provides predictability in operations, eases testing, and codifies expections for developer operators.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="operable">
  <h3>Operable</h3>
    <p>
      Operability refers to the ability of a system to keep its operators informed of its state and the information about that state in the past, present, and when known, future 
      and to hold that state constant given changes in the state or availability of surrounding resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps handles failure as a first class citizen. In any distributed system, failure is inevitable. PanOps handles failures in underlying resources by continuously monitoring
      and reacting to resource state changes, automatically reconverging the system to its goal state without human interaction. Only if PanOps is or may be unable to successfully 
      automatically reconverge the system to the specified goal state is corrective action required.
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of operability is understanding that complete system failure in the face of calamity is always a possibility. PanOps platform services will make every effort to ensure
      a clean shutdown or degredation of affected services and a quick return to fully functional operation when a large enough number of resources have been restored to support the
      applications workload.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps components chronicle all actions, decisions, and considerations and their reasons in a standard format using a standard interface for retrieval so
      that if human intervention into system operation is required to debug a problem or correct an issue context may be quickly gathered and effective corrective action may be taken.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="distributed">
  <h3>Distributed</h3>
    <p>
      The distributed nature of arbitrary sets of resources on which the management system resides, most of which can fail at any time, require that a system designed for managing those 
      resources itself also be distributed. As such, no node participating in a PanOps resource management system is special, and any node may take over the functions of any other node 
      at any time, should that take over be determined to be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      PanOps services take great care to ensure that durable state is maintained consistently in multiple locations, the placement of which is designed to survive multiple resource failure or
      destruction. This process requires PanOps to be resource placement aware, and so, resource placement and dependencies are central to resource metadata management and greatly effect how
      PanOps places its own service on available resources.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="secure">
  <h3>Secure</h3>
    <p>
      PanOps services understand that the world in which components exist may be byzantine. Therefore, messages sent between components are signed, and if applicable, encrypted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To implement this requirement, all services verify the signature and identity of the sender of incomming messages and verify the authorization of the sender to perform the requested 
      operation or communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Resources are segmented into trusted and untrusted spheres. This feature enables automatic unencrypted low-overhead communication between distributed components/resources where the 
      communications medium over which the communication shall pass is under the complete control of a Developer Operator trusted entity while still allowing the PanOps system to maintain security 
      guarantees when additional untrusted resources (for example, a utility compuing account) are added to the PanOps operating theater. Another example of an application this feature enables would be
      the secure storage of PanOps system private keys and certificates, such that PanOps is free to move this private information within the trusted sphere to ensure reliability while not exposing it 
      to untrusted networks or storage media.
