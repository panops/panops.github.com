<h2>Reporting an issue</h2>

  <p>
  PanOps uses <a href="https://github.com/panops/panops/issues">GitHub Issue Tracking</a> to track issues (primarily
  bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug in PanOps, this is the place to start. You'll need to
  create a (free) GitHub account in order to either submit an issue, comment on them or create pull requests.
  </p>
  
  <p class="note">
  Bugs in the most recent released version of PanOps are likely to get the most attention. Also, the PanOps core team
  is always interested in feedback from those who can take the time to test <a href="/lexicon#edge_PanOps"><em>edge PanOps</em></a>.
  Later in this guide you'll find out how to get edge PanOps for testing.
  </p>
  
  <div class="section" id="creating_a_bug_report">
  <h3>Creating a bug report</h3>
  
    <p>
    If you've found a problem in PanOps which is not a security risk do a seach in GitHub Issues in case it was already
    reported. If you find no issue addressing it you can <a href="https://github.com/panops/panops/issues/new">add a new one</a>.
    (See the next section for reporting security issues.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
    At the minimum, your issue preport needs a title and descriptive text. But that's only a minimum. You should include
    as much relevant information as possible. You need to at least post the code sample that has the issue. Even better
    is to include a unit test that shows how the expected behavior is not occurring. Your goal should be to make it easy
    for yourself -- and others -- to replicate the bug and figure out a fix.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Then don't get your hopes up. Unless you have a "Code Red, Mission Critical, The World is Coming to an End" kind of bug, you're
    creating the report in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect
    the issue report will automatically see any activity or that others will just to fix it. Creating an issue like this is mostly to
    help yourself start on the path of fixing the problem and for others to confirm it with a "I'm having this problem too" statement.
    </p>

  <div class="section" id="special_treatment_for_security_issues">
  <h3>Special treatment for security issues</h3>
  
    <p class="warning">
    Please do not report security vulnerabilities with public GitHub issue reports. The <a href="/security">PanOps security policy page</a> 
    details the procedure to follow for security issues.
    </p>
  
  </div>
  
  <div class="section" id="what_about_feature_requests">
  <h3>What about feature requests?</h3>
  
    <p>
    Please don't put "Feature Request" items into GitHub Issues. If there's a new feature that you want to see added to PanOps, you'll need to
    write the code yourself -- or convince someone else to partner with you to write the code. Later in this guide you'll find detailed instructions
    for proposing a patch to PanOps. If you enter a wishlist item in GitHub Issues with no code, you can expect it to be marked 'invalid' as soon as it's
    reviewed.
